# Data Pipeline Management Plan
## Overview

This document outlines the management plan for data pipelines responsible for delivering critical business metrics. These pipelines support key areas including profit, growth, and engagement, enabling data-driven decisions and transparent reporting to investors.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this document is to define ownership, establish an on-call schedule, and provide detailed runbooks for each pipeline. It ensures timely delivery of metrics, highlights potential risks, and sets clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to maintain operational reliability and investor confidence.

## Ownership Assignment

### Primary and Secondary Owners

| Pipeline | Primary Owner | Secondary Owner | Comment |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Profit - Unit-level Profit | Engineer A | Engineer B | Expand on Ownership Reasons: Explain why specific engineers were chosen for particular pipelines. Highlight their expertise or relevant experience.|
| Profit - Aggregate Profit | Engineer B | Engineer C | Engineer B has prior experience with aggregation pipelines and reporting structures. |
| Growth - Aggregate Growth | Engineer C | Engineer D | Engineer C has worked on growth tracking systems, complemented by D's analytical skills. |
| Growth - Daily Growth | Engineer D | Engineer A | Engineer D has expertise in real-time data processing, backed by A's experience in experiments. |
| Engagement - Aggregate Engagement | Engineer A | Engineer D| Engineer A excels in user engagement analytics, with D providing additional tool expertise. |

## On-Call Schedule

### Rotation Plan
- **Weekly Rotation**: Each engineer rotates as the primary on-call engineer every week, with the next engineer in line acting as secondary backup.
- **Holiday Coverage**: Predefined swaps or backup plans will be implemented for holidays to ensure fair distribution.

| Week | Primary On-Call | Secondary On-Call |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Week 1 | Engineer A | Engineer B |
| Week 2 | Engineer B | Engineer C |
| Week 3 | Engineer C | Engineer D |
| Week 4 | Engineer D | Engineer A |

**Examples for Holiday:**
- *Thanksgiving Week*: Engineer A covers the first half of the week, and Engineer B covers the second half.
- *Christmas and New Year*: Engineer D covers Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, while Engineer C covers New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
- *Flexible Swaps*: Engineers may negotiate swaps in advance if they have personal commitments.

## Run Books

### Profit 
**Purpose**:
This pipeline is designed to track and calculate unit-level profitability metrics, enabling detailed financial analysis for experimental purposes. It processes transactional data, revenue records, and cost structures to evaluate performance at the most granular level.

#### - Unit-level Profit
##### Potential Issues:

- Data source API downtime.
- Incorrect mapping or data schema changes.
- Processing lag causing incomplete datasets.

##### SLA:
- Metrics must be available within 6 hours of experiment start.

##### Mitigation:
- Validate schema changes weekly.
- Use redundant data sources when possible.
- Implement automated retries for API failures.

#### Aggregate Profit

##### Potential Issues:
- Database connection failures.
- Aggregation logic bugs.
- Report delivery delays.

##### SLA:
- Reports must be available to investors by 9 AM next business day.

##### Mitigation:
- Implement database connection monitoring.
- Add unit tests for aggregation logic.
- Pre-schedule report generation with retries.

### Growth 
**Purpose**:
This pipeline tracks and reports aggregate growth metrics, including revenue and user acquisition trends. It provides insights into overall business expansion and performance, which are essential for investor reporting and strategic decision-making.
#### Aggregate Growth

##### Potential Issues:
- Missing input data from daily pipelines.
- Outliers causing inaccurate aggregations.
- Formatting errors in investor reports.

##### SLA:
- Reports must be finalized by 10 AM daily.

##### Mitigation:
- Validate input data before processing.
- Use outlier detection algorithms.
- Implement formatting checks for outputs.

### Daily Growth

##### Potential Issues:
- Late or incomplete data ingestion.
- Scheduling conflicts for batch jobs.
- Data discrepancies between systems.

##### SLA:
- Data must be available for experiments by 12 PM daily.

##### Mitigation:
- Implement job scheduling monitoring.
- Reconcile data between systems nightly.
- Notify stakeholders immediately for delays.

### Engagement
**Purpose**:
This pipeline aggregates engagement metrics such as user interactions, session durations, and activity patterns. It provides insights into user behavior, helping investors evaluate platform health and audience retention.

#### Aggregate Engagement

##### Potential Issues:
- Data source permissions revocation.
- Script failures due to updates in tools.
- Visualization tool outages affecting reports.

##### SLA:
- Reports must be updated by 8 AM every Monday.

##### Mitigation:
- Perform permissions audits bi-weekly.
- Maintain version control for scripts.
- Create backups of visualizations for manual delivery if needed.

### SLA
Meeting these SLAs is critical for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring transparency in performance reporting. Timely and accurate data delivery enables investors to make informed decisions, fosters trust, and demonstrates operational reliability. For example, delays in reporting profitability or growth metrics may lead to uncertainty, impacting investor sentiment and potential funding opportunities.

## Final Notes
- Regular reviews of ownership and on-call schedules will occur quarterly.
- Emergency response drills will be conducted bi-annually to ensure readiness.
- Any updates to pipelines or processes will be documented and communicated promptly.
